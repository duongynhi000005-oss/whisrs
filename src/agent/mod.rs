//! Agent mode: send a voice (or typed) instruction to a coding agent session
//! running in a configured directory, and hear a short reply when its turn
//! ends (`[[agents]]`).
//!
//! This module holds what both binaries share: the `[[agents]]` config and
//! its validation, the IPC types, the driver abstraction every harness
//! implements and the default spoken-reply instruction, plus the pure parts
//! of what an agent says and shows while it works ([`progress`],
//! [`display`]). The runtime that owns the sessions lives in the daemon
//! (`src/daemon/agent.rs`).
//!
//! Two driver shapes fit [`Driver`]: Claude Code's turn is launched as a
//! background session and ends on a hook event or a poll
//! ([`claude::ClaudeDriver`]); a process-per-turn driver (phase 2: OpenCode,
//! Codex, Copilot) spawns one child per turn with `kill_on_drop`, reads the
//! session id and the final message from its JSON output, and returns when
//! the child exits. The runtime only ever calls the [`Driver`] methods.
