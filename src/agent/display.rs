//! What the agent overlay shows: one row per active agent, composed from
//! what the runtime reports.
//!
//! [`Board`] keeps, per configured agent, its running turn (with the
//! activity line and whether it waits for you), how its last turn ended,
//! and whether a reply of its is queued or playing; plus the one agent the
//! voice belongs to right now (listening, transcribing or speaking).
//! [`Board::compose`] turns that into rows, in config order, each in the
//! state that wins: voice, then needs-you, then working, then done or error.
//!
//! A finished turn's Done or Error row holds while that agent's reply is
//! queued or playing, then for [`DONE_HOLD`], then fades over
//! [`DONE_FADE`] and is gone. The overlay has room for [`MAX_ROWS`]
//! ([`rows`] splits a composition into what fits and a "+N more" count).
//!
//! Pure, no clock: every time is passed in, so a test (or a renderer
//! animating a fade between two compositions) decides what "now" is.
