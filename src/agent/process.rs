//! The process-per-turn driver: each turn is one harness process that prints
//! JSON lines and exits (OpenCode's `opencode run`, Codex's `codex exec`). A
//! harness module says how a turn starts and what a line of its output means
//! ([`TurnHarness`]); [`ProcessDriver`] does the rest, the same for every such
//! harness:
//!
//! - **Spawn:** the agent's `command` with the harness's arguments, in the
//!   agent's dir, with the daemon's environment minus what a parent session
//!   sets for the processes it runs (Claude Code's,
//!   [`super::claude::strips_env`], and the harness's own,
//!   [`TurnHarness::strips_env`]) and with `PWD` set to the dir: a cwd alone
//!   leaves the daemon's `PWD`, and OpenCode resolves its directory from
//!   `PWD`. In a process group of its own, and in a transient systemd scope
//!   of its own ([`TurnScopes`], `systemd-run --user --scope`, which execs
//!   the harness as the same process), so a stop reaches every process the
//!   turn started, also one that left the group for a session of its own
//!   (Copilot's tool shells do). Without `systemd-run`, or when it cannot
//!   make the scope, the harness is started directly. Stdin is the prompt,
//!   then closed, or `/dev/null`: OpenCode and Codex read an open stdin until
//!   it ends.
//! - **The session:** an id the launch names that the agent does not have
//!   yet (OpenCode's, minted by whisrs, [`Launch::session`]) is reported as
//!   soon as the process runs, pending ([`SessionRef::pending`]) until a
//!   text or a tool call shows the agent working in it; an id the output
//!   names is reported when it is new.
//! - **The daemon's end ends the turn:** the child is spawned from a thread
//!   that waits for it, with `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` = SIGINT, so it is
//!   interrupted when the daemon exits or dies. A turn never outlives its
//!   daemon (it would run unwatched, and the next turn would run beside it):
//!   what a turn left in its scope (a process that ignored the SIGINT) is
//!   stopped when the next daemon starts ([`TurnScopes::sweep`]), and a turn
//!   watched again after a restart ends at once ([`cut_off`]).
//! - **Output:** stdout line by line ([`TurnHarness::events`]): a tool call
//!   is an activity ([`activity_for_tool`]) and releases the assistant text
//!   before it as an interim ([`InterimTracker`]), and the text of the last
//!   message is the reply. Stderr is kept for the error, which the harness
//!   may recognize ([`TurnHarness::stderr_failure`]). A line is never kept
//!   whole past a cap ([`STDOUT_LINE_MAX`], [`STDERR_LINE_MAX`]).
//! - **Stop:** SIGINT, then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, each sent only while
//!   something of the turn is left, after the previous one's grace
//!   ([`STOP_GRACES`]), to the process group, to every process of the tree
//!   seen so far ([`Tree`]) and to the scope (`systemctl --user kill`). A
//!   turn dropped while its process runs (its task aborted), or stopped
//!   before its process was registered, is stopped the same way, and
//!   `--stop` waits for that stop.
//!
//! Between turns no process runs: a session never works on its own, waits
//! for a prompt or sends a hook.
