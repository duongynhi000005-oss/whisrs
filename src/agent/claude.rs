//! The Claude Code driver: each turn is a background session (`claude --bg`).
//!
//! - First turn: `claude --bg --name whisrs-<agent> --permission-mode <m>
//!   --append-system-prompt <instruction> --settings <hooks> [args] -- <text>`.
//!   `--bg` prints `backgrounded · <bg id>`; the bg id is reported (and
//!   persisted) at once, then the session id is read from `claude agents
//!   --json --all` by that bg id (`--session-id` is ignored with `--bg`,
//!   measured on 2.1.301). The appended prompt is recorded on the first
//!   request and reused on every resume, so it is passed once.
//! - Next turn: refused while `claude agents` shows the session `working` (it
//!   runs on its own, and stopping it would lose that work). Otherwise
//!   `claude stop <bg id>` while its process is alive, a wait until `claude
//!   agents` lists it with no pid and the process it listed has exited
//!   (`claude stop` returns, and the listing drops the pid, before Claude
//!   Code settles the session), then `claude --bg --resume <session id> --
//!   <text>`, which keeps the session id and the saved options (`--settings`
//!   and `--remote-control` included). Any other flag, or a resume while the
//!   old process still runs, starts a copy without them. Every pid a listing
//!   shows is remembered until it is seen to exit, so a session stopped
//!   elsewhere (listed with no pid while its process still exits) is waited
//!   for too. A copy is never adopted: it is stopped, waited for and
//!   removed (never the session's own bg id), and the resume is tried once
//!   more after the old process is gone; a second copy fails the turn.
//! - Turn end: the `Stop` hook (`whisrs agent-hook`, installed through
//!   `--settings` on whisrs-started sessions only) carries
//!   `last_assistant_message`. Only a `Stop` received after this turn's launch
//!   counts: the old process of a resumed session can still send one. A
//!   `Notification` of type `permission_prompt` marks the agent needs-you. A
//!   poll of `claude agents --json --all` every ten seconds covers a missing
//!   hook: `done` reads the last assistant text from the transcript (and a
//!   `done` with none for a few polls is an interrupted turn); a vanished or
//!   exited session is an error.
//! - Under a systemd service, `--bg` launches run in a scope of their own
//!   (`systemd-run --user --scope`): the first one can start Claude Code's
//!   background service, which hosts every background session, the user's
//!   own included, and must not die with the whisrs unit.
//!
//! Only ids this driver learned from sessions whisrs started are ever passed
//! to `claude`; nothing is matched by name.
